#Corperwee
This is just a basic web application built using AngularJs.

It's basic use is to help create a central database of places(hotels, churches, lodges etc) in major towns in Nigeria where Corpers are posted. 

It uses basic rating logic to help them find the very best places for any of their needs in their state of deployment.

Use case: You need to get a good lodge for the service year, this app can show you the best lodges in your area, based on review and ratings by previous corpers in the area.

This is the front-end part of the project. The back-end can be found here https://github.com/ajibigad/corperwee-spring
